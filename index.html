    <p>Hello, welcome to my website, basically this website is where I do blogposts and post my mods on, the mods page isn't available for full view yet because I'm still working on my first mod (Copper's Entity Mod)</p>
    <p>And what I plan to do with this mod is basically just make weird entities for minecraft for experimental stuff and add it to the mod and this is my first project so it'd probably be terrible when I release the first version :D</p>
